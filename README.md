# Natixis DeepHedging Project X-HEC DSB 2023

Recent progress achieved inÂ data science and deep learningÂ make aÂ model independent approachÂ for hedging possible
These hedging approaches well known as deep hedging are machine learning algorithms able to consider market frictions as well as trading constraintsÂ without using risk sensitivities metrics computed by pricing models.
The objective of the challenge is to replace classical hedging strategies founded on the calculation of risk sensitivities (Greeks) by machine learning algorithms.


## Getting started with the repository

To ensure that all libraries are installed pip install the requirements file:

```
pip install - r requirements.txt
```

To run the model go to the console and run following command: 

```
python main.py
```
